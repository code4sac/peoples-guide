Converting the People's Guide to a digital format

## 9-16-20

Met with Joanne who described the People's Guide: https://c0971773-8bd3-49d2-b4d7-2a0c0b43036d.filesusr.com/ugd/ee52bb_e37a55c3be3e4f0ab70c594ff81228d7.pdf created an maintained by https://www.srceh.org/.  They maintain the data and content in this guide and it is very useful, we can improve the distribution of this valuable content by putting in a digital form.

Investigated an updated version ORServices that includes some management tools.  We may be able to use this: https://openreferral.org/presenting-orservices-3-0-a-complete-laravel-based-open-referral-directory-solution/

# Inital Prototype

## Objectives
1. Have a website that displays the content in the people's guide
2. Allow maintainers to easily update and add content
3. Make a map available for the brick and mortor based resources
4. Have a way for people to navigate to the information relevant to them (i.e. wizard or questionairre)

## Project

Create an inital wordpress site with a page or two that contains some of the content in the people's guide.
Add some resource data to something like a google spreadsheet or airtable that we can populate on a page or map via an api.  The spreadshee makes the data easier to maintain than a database.

## Progress

Created an initial site on Wordpress.com -- Still need to add pages/posts.
